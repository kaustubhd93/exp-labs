        <h1> HTML and CSS is hard </h1>
        <p>Let's learn some basics of HTML first.</p>

        <h2> Headings </h2>
        <p> Headings define the outline of your site. There are 6 levels of headings.</p>

        <h2> Lists </h2>
        <p> This is how you make an unordered list: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Add a "ul" element in a block format. </li>
            <li> Then add an "li" element inside the "ul" block </li>
            <li> No element needs to be in any particular order. </li>
            <p> Adding a paragraph in a "li" element. As you can see this does not work.
                Only "li" is allowed inside the "ul" block </p>
            <li><p> Adding a paragraph in a "li" element.
                This works because the paragraph is wrapped inside a "li" element.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p> This is how you make an ordered list: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Create a "ol" block and add a "li" element inside it. </li>
            <li> No need to add numbers, the serial no for next element will auto increment. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2> Inline Elements </h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a particular word.</p>
        <p><strong><em>And sometimes you need to shout</em></strong></p>

        <h2> Empty Elements </h2>
        <p> Thank you for reading, HTML might not seem that daunting anymore, does it?</p>
        <p>Regards,<br/>
