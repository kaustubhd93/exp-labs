        <p>The Site is primarily operated from and hosted on servers located in the United States.
            If you access and use the Site from a location outside of the United States, any personal
            data you provide to us or that is otherwise collected may be transferred to and processed
            in the United States or any other jurisdiction in our sole discretion. Users of the Site
            should be aware that the laws that apply to the use and protection of personal data in
            the United States or other countries or jurisdictions to which we transfer or in which
            we process personal data may differ from those of your country of residence. Accordingly,
            the level of safeguards and legal protections provided in the United States and other
            countries outside of the European Union ("EU") from which you may access our Site may
            not be as stringent as that under the EU or the privacy laws of some other countries,
            possibly including your own jurisdiction. Those who access or use the Site from
            jurisdictions outside of the United States do so at their own choice and risk and
             are solely responsible for compliance with local law. While we take steps to
             safeguard your personal data, the United States has NOT been deemed by the European
             Commission to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data</p>
