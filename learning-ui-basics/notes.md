# Gist of UI components:

- HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up.
- CSS is formatting that marked up content.
- JavaScript is for making that content and formatting, interactive.

# Structure of an HTML document:

- An HTML doc opens with an HTML tag and also closes with it.
- ```<!DOCTYPE html>```: The browser checks for this tag and identifies the page in HTML5.
- Between the html tag there are 2 sections: "head" and "body".
- "head" is where the Meta-data goes and "body" is where the content goes.
- "head" includes: Page Title, CSS links, Other abstract things.
- "body" includes: headings, paragraphs, other things you can see.

# Other type of content:

- The other major type of content is "inline elements" or "phrasing content".
- For example: ```<em>``` is for emphasizing and italicizing the text and ```<strong>``` makes the text bold.

# Empty HTML elements:

- Line breaks and horizontal rules are the most common empty elements.
- Line break: ```<br/>```
- Horizontal rule is used to separate a section prominently. Using this displays a line.
- Horizontal rule: ```<hr/>```
